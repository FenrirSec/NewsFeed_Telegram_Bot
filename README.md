# NewsFeed Telegram Bot 🤖

Welcome to the NewsFeed Telegram Bot repository! This bot, written in Python, lets you manage and share links via Telegram. 

## How Does It Work? 📋

In your Telegram channel, you have three commands to interact with the bot:

- `/begin`: The bot sends you a welcome message.
- `/help`: The bot lists all available commands.
- `/link`: Insert your link, and the bot will save it into a JSON file on your GitHub repository.

## Setup Instructions 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fenrirsec/NewsFeed_Telegram_Bot.git
    ```

2. Update the path of your JSON file and the Telegram bot token in the script.

3. Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

## Don't Forget 🚨

Make sure to update the file path and token if you plan to use this bot in another Telegram channel.

Happy linking! 🚀
